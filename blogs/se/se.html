    <!-- Main Blog Content -->
    <p>Forget self-driving cars. The real action is in self-landing rockets and billionaire space races. What was once the domain of superpowers is now a playground for tech moguls with dreams bigger than their bank accounts. But what does this new era of cosmic competition mean for the rest of us Earthlings?</p>

    <h2>1. The Moon is the New Coffee Shop</h2>
    <p>Everyone's opening a branch on the Moon. Lunar bases are no longer sci-fi; they're the ultimate real estate project. Scientists are excited about the research potential. Engineers are solving how to build with moon dust. Marketing teams are already brainstorming slogans: "Lunar Latte - It's out of this world!" The real challenge? Figuring out a postal code for the Moon. "MOON 1"?</p>

    <h2>2. Mars or Bust (Mostly Bust, So Far)</h2>
    <p>Mars is the ultimate fixer-upper project. The journey takes months, the atmosphere is toxic, and the soil is literally poisonous. Yet, we're determined to go. The latest rovers are like advanced robotic geologists, sending back selfies and analyzing rocks. They've discovered ancient riverbeds, which is exciting. They've also discovered that Martian dust gets <em>everywhere</em>, which is less exciting for future colonists who hate cleaning.</p>
    <p>Here's a simplified version of what a rover's daily status check might look like in code:</p>
    <pre><code>// Martian Rover Daily Log
const todaysStatus = {
    date: "2025-12-15",
    location: "Jezero Crater",
    mission: "Collect rock samples",
    problems: [
        "Solar panels dusty (again)",
        "Left wheel making a squeaky noise",
        "Curiosity rover sent a teasing text about its better view"
    ],
    mood: "Persevering"
};
console.log(`Reporting for duty! Status: ${todaysStatus.mood}`);</code></pre>

    <h2>3. Space Tourism: A Postcard from Zero-G</h2>
    <p>Yes, you can now vacation in space if you have a few million dollars lying around. The reviews are mixed. Pros: The view is unbeatable. Zero-gravity floating is fun. Cons: The food is still questionable. Packing light takes on a whole new meaning. And good luck trying to describe the experience to your friends back home without sounding utterly insufferable. "Oh, the sunset from orbit? It was fine, I guess."</p>

        <p>Set a timer for your imaginary mission to Europa (one of Jupiter's moons). How long can you handle the journey?</p>
        <p><strong>Mission Duration:</strong> <span id="countdownDisplay">05:00</span> minutes</p>

    <h2>4. The Cosmic Economy: Asteroids are Full of Cash?</h2>
    <p>The next gold rush won't be on Earth—it'll be in the asteroid belt. These space rocks contain precious metals worth quintillions of dollars. The legal framework for "space mining" is currently messier than a toddler's art project. Who owns an asteroid? Can you claim a planet? These are the questions keeping space lawyers in business.</p>

    <p>In conclusion, space exploration is advancing at light speed, driven by both profound curiosity and the potential for profit. We're learning, building, and dreaming of a multi-planetary future. Just remember, when you finally book that ticket to Mars, pack extra snacks and maybe a really, really long Ethernet cable.</p>
